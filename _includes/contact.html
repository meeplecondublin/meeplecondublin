                <hr class="primary">
                <p><b>Meeple Con</b> is a day of board gaming, focused on longer and/or high complexity games (examples include Splotter Games, Pax Games, Through the Ages, Mage Knight, Eclipse, etc). These games often are hard to get to the table due to length or rules complexity. To help create the best experience we are looking for people to volunteer to facilitate their game, and the con will assign players to games to best match their preference. This ensures every one is playing a game, players can learn the rules in advance and games can be sized for best the experience.</p>
